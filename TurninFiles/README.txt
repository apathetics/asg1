Project 1: Lexical Anylizer

The project works correctly to the best of my knowledge. There may
be some special cases of ints or floating point that get through
my bounds checking, but I hadn't found any as of turnin time.

My only misgiving is that I didn't have time to code up a table for the
reserved keywords. I had already written a switch version and I decided
not to mess around with changing something that already worked until
I got everything else working. I hope this is satisfactory.
